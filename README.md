Overview of the project

Project: To track and manage students grade
objective:
Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The
program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
GPA).

Key Activities:
input grades for different subjects or assignments
calculate the average grade
display the overall
grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA).


Technology used:
PYTHON

Program Overview

The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade and GPA.

Key Features:

Student Profile: The program creates a student profile with a name and an empty grade book.
Grade Input: Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments, which are stored in the student's grade book.
Average Grade Calculation: The program calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades.
Letter Grade and GPA Conversion: The program converts the average grade to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and a GPA (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, or 0.0) based on the average grade.
Grade Display: The program displays the student's grades, average grade, letter grade, and GPA.


Program Flow:

The user inputs the student's name.
The program presents a menu to add grades, display grades, or quit.
If the user chooses to add a grade, they input the subject and grade, which is stored in the student's grade book.
If the user chooses to display grades, the program calculates the average grade, converts it to a letter grade and GPA, and displays all the grades, average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
The user can repeat steps 2-4 until they choose to quit the program.


Benefits:

The Student Grade Tracker program provides an easy-to-use interface for tracking and managing student grades, making it a useful tool for teachers, students, and parents.
